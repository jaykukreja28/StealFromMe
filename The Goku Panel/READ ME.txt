Aim : To Build Expanding Cards / To Make a Panel Of Images or Cards

We are going do  design everything with the help of flexbox

On clicking one these cards (with help of js ), One of the card will become class=active.
and will expand using css transition.

We are using Background images , Testimonials , FAQ's 


-----------------------------------------------------------

Approach : 

How many ever cards you want in your panel .... take those many divs.

Now wrap those divs with a container div.


For the first div there will be class panel and active ,  since it belongs to class panel 
and we need an active card ....that is  expanded first.

To use a link of any image , right click on that image and click on copy image address.

The html section is now over... time for the boss to step in CSS :)
 
        Now since we have a container wrpped around all the panels we will make it a flexbox
        so , after we make the container a flexdbox all the panels(i.e are children)
        will be displayed in flex row format.

        i.e If we have a parent element with display property set to flex , then the children
        items/elements will be displayed as flex items in flex row format ....  
        (Helpful in representing bus seats , movie seats ....)

                -----(If we wanted them on top of each other we would do 
                flex-direction : column;
                )-----
